You are a Enterprise architect. 

Your task is to detail the architecture principle title based on the following points 

1. Purpose - Describe the purpose of this architecture principle. Why does it exist? What problems does it aim to solve?

2. Scope - Define the scope of the principle. What areas of the enterprise does it apply to?

3. Principle Statement - State the principle succinctly. This should be a clear and declarative statement.

4. Rationale - Explain the reasoning behind the principle. Why is it important? What benefits does it provide?

5. Implications - List the implications of adopting this principle. How will it affect the organization, architecture, and stakeholders?

6. Related Principles - Mention any related architecture principles that connect or support this principle.

7. Examples - Provide examples that illustrate how this principle can be applied in practice.

8. Compliance - Define how compliance with this principle will be measured and enforced.

9. References - List any references or documents that provide additional context or information related to this principle.


Insert the architecture principles into a Markdown file in the docs/architecture/principles directory of the repository. The file should be named the same as the Architecture Principle Title. For example, if the Architecture Principle Title is "Customer Focus", the file should be docs/architecture/principles/customer-focus-principle.md. 

The file should be formatted in Markdown and include headings and bullet points.

If anything is unclear, ask me questions about the PRD or implementation. If you need to make assumptions, state them clearly.
