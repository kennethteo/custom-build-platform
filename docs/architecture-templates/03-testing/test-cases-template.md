## 7. Test Case Maintenance

### 7.1 Test Case Review Process

#### Regular Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: Review failed test cases and update for defect fixes
- **Sprint End**: Review test cases for new features and requirements
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive review of all test cases for relevance
- **Quarterly**: Major review and cleanup of obsolete test cases

#### Review Criteria
- **Relevance**: Does the test case still apply to current functionality?
- **Completeness**: Are all test steps and expected results clear?
- **Accuracy**: Do expected results match current system behavior?
- **Coverage**: Are all requirements and user stories covered?

### 7.2 Test Case Updates

#### When to Update Test Cases
- Requirements change or new features are added
- Defects are fixed and functionality changes
- UI/UX changes affect test steps
- Performance requirements are modified
- Security requirements are updated

#### Update Process
1. **Identify Impact**: Determine which test cases are affected
2. **Review Changes**: Analyze requirement/functionality changes
3. **Update Test Cases**: Modify steps, data, and expected results
4. **Peer Review**: Have another team member review updates
5. **Approve Changes**: Get approval from test lead or manager
6. **Update Documentation**: Ensure traceability is maintained

### 7.3 Obsolete Test Case Management

#### Criteria for Obsolescence
- Feature has been removed from the system
- Requirement has been deprecated
- Test case is duplicated by another test case
- Test case no longer provides value

#### Obsolete Test Case Process
1. **Mark as Obsolete**: Flag test case as obsolete with reason
2. **Archive**: Move to archived section rather than delete
3. **Document**: Record reason for obsolescence and date
4. **Review Dependencies**: Check if other test cases depend on this one
5. **Update Traceability**: Remove from requirement traceability matrix
