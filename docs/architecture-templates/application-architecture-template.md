Application Architecture Template
1. Overview

Purpose: Describe the purpose of the application architecture and its alignment with business goals.
Scope: Outline the boundaries of the application architecture, including components and interfaces.
2. Stakeholders

Business Stakeholders: List involved business users and departments.
Technical Stakeholders: Identify technical teams, developers, and architects.
3. Use Cases

Primary Use Cases: Document the main use cases that the application will support.
User Roles: Define user roles involved in each use case.
4. Context Diagram

Diagram: Provide a diagram illustrating system boundaries and interactions with external entities.
External Systems: List and describe external systems that interact with the application.
