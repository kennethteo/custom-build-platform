The Architecture Review Board (ARB) Charter Template serves as a formal document that outlines the purpose, structure, roles, responsibilities, and processes of the ARB within an organization, acting as a governance framework aligned with best practices and methodologies such as TOGAF. This template typically includes sections detailing the ARB's objectives, which include ensuring architectural compliance with organizational standards, facilitating collaboration among stakeholders, and fostering the strategic alignment of IT initiatives with business goals. By defining the scope of review processes, membership criteria, decision-making authority, and communication protocols, the ARB Charter establishes a clear foundation for evaluating and approving architectural decisions, thereby enhancing accountability, reducing risk, and promoting alignment with the enterprise architecture vision.
