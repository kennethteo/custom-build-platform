The Custom Build Digital Experience Application and Services Plane is the layer where digital applications and services are implemented using a microservices architecture and API-driven approach.

This plane is divided into three categories:

1. **Digital Experience Applications**: All application with user interfaces will be placed here

2. **Application Services**: These are services specific to individual applications, tailored to meet the unique requirements of each digital experience.

   Examples include:
    - Business logic and workflows specific to the application.
    - APIs that expose application-specific functionality to external systems.

3. **Platform (Shared) Services**: These are reusable services shared across multiple applications, designed to provide foundational capabilities and ensure consistency.

   Examples include:
     - Identity and access management.
     - API gateway and integration services.
     - Observability and monitoring tools.
     - Security and compliance mechanisms.
     - Data storage and analytics services.

This plane is designed to be modular, scalable, and extensible, enabling seamless integration with external systems while ensuring high performance and reliability. Developers can leverage well-documented APIs, SDKs, and integration tools to build and deploy applications efficiently. The architecture supports interoperability, allowing applications to connect with diverse tools and technologies while maintaining adaptability to evolving requirements.
