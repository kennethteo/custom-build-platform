# Architecture Principles

## Guiding Principles

This document outlines the business and technical guiding principles for the Custom Build Platform.

## Business Guiding Principles

### Customer Focus

- **Customer Focus**: Prioritize the needs and expectations of end-users to deliver value-driven solutions.
- **Innovation**: Foster a culture of creativity and continuous improvement to stay ahead in the market.
- **Collaboration**: Encourage teamwork and open communication among stakeholders to achieve shared goals.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize processes and resource utilization to maximize productivity and minimize waste.
- **User-Centric Design**: Focus on delivering value and usability for end-users.
- **Business Agility**: Adapt quickly to changing market conditions and customer needs through flexible processes and decision-making.
  - Designing processes and systems that support quick iteration and deployment of new features.
  - Encouraging a flexible and responsive culture that embraces change and continuous improvement.
  - Empowering teams to make data-driven decisions and pivot strategies as needed.
  - Implementing modular and loosely coupled architectures to enable independent updates and scaling.
  - Leveraging automation and DevOps practices to reduce time-to-market and increase operational efficiency.
  - Continuously gathering feedback from users and stakeholders to inform product direction and priorities.
- **Cost Optimization**: Design and operate the platform to maximize value while minimizing costs.
  - Leveraging auto-scaling and serverless technologies to match resource usage with demand.
  - Utilizing managed services and open-source solutions where appropriate to reduce operational overhead.
  - Implementing multi-tenancy to share resources efficiently across customers.
  - Continuously monitoring and analyzing cloud and infrastructure spend to identify optimization opportunities.
  - Automating the shutdown of non-production environments when not in use.
  - Regularly reviewing and right-sizing compute, storage, and network resources.
  - Promoting a culture of cost awareness and accountability among engineering teams.

## Technical Guiding Principles

- **Modularity**: Design components to be independent and reusable. The platform will be composed of independent, reusable components that can be developed, tested, and deployed separately. This approach enables easier maintenance, faster development cycles, and the flexibility to upgrade or replace individual modules without impacting the entire system.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the platform can handle increasing workloads efficiently. The system is designed to efficiently handle increasing workloads by supporting horizontal and vertical scaling. Services can be distributed across multiple nodes, and resources can be dynamically allocated to meet demand, ensuring consistent performance as usage grows.
- **Security**: Implement strong security measures to protect data and systems. Security is integrated at every layer of the platform, including strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, data encryption in transit and at rest, and regular security audits. The platform adheres to industry best practices and compliance standards to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Resiliency**: Ensure the platform can recover quickly from failures and maintain continuous operation. Resiliency is achieved through strategies such as redundancy, failover mechanisms, and automated recovery processes. The platform is designed to handle unexpected disruptions gracefully, minimizing downtime and impact on users. This includes:
  - Implementing multi-region deployments to ensure availability during regional outages.
  - Utilizing distributed systems and replication to safeguard data integrity.
  - Monitoring system health and performance to detect and address issues proactively.
  - Designing services with fault tolerance and self-healing capabilities.
  - Conducting regular disaster recovery drills to validate recovery procedures.
  - Leveraging load balancing to distribute traffic and prevent bottlenecks.
  - Ensuring critical components have backup systems and failover configurations.
- **Maintainability**: Facilitate easy updates and enhancements to the platform. The codebase and infrastructure are structured to facilitate easy updates, debugging, and enhancements. Clear documentation, automated testing, and standardized development practices help ensure that the platform remains reliable and adaptable to changing requirements.
- **Interoperability**: Support integration with diverse tools and technologies. The platform is designed to seamlessly connect with a wide range of third-party systems, services, and protocols, enabling users and partners to leverage existing investments and accelerate solution delivery. For example, a partner can integrate their CRM system with the platform using REST APIs to automate customer onboarding, or a customer can connect their on-premises data warehouse via standardized connectors to enable real-time analytics. This includes:
  - Providing well-documented APIs such as REST and GraphQL, and webhooks for external integrations.
  - Supporting industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms (OAuth2, SAML, OpenID Connect).
  - Ensuring compatibility with popular CI/CD, monitoring, and DevOps tools.
  - Enabling data exchange through standardized formats (JSON, XML, CSV) and protocols.
  - Facilitating integration with both cloud-native and on-premises systems.
  - Maintaining clear versioning and backward compatibility for APIs to minimize integration disruptions.
  - Offering SDKs and client libraries in multiple programming languages (such as Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, and Go) to accelerate partner and customer adoption.
