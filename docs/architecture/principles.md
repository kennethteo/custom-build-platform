## Guiding Principles

This document outlines the business and technical guiding principles for the Custom Build Platform.

## Business Guiding Principles

### Customer Focus

**Purpose**
This architecture principle exists to ensure that all technology decisions, system designs, and platform capabilities are fundamentally driven by customer needs and value delivery. It aims to solve the common problems of:
- Technology-first solutions that fail to address real business problems
- Over-engineering systems that don't provide commensurate customer value
- Disconnect between technical capabilities and customer expectations
- Inefficient resource allocation on features that don't drive customer success
- Poor user experience resulting from inside-out design thinking

**Scope**
This principle applies across all enterprise domains including:
- Application architecture and system design
- User interface and experience design
- API design and integration patterns
- Data architecture and analytics platforms
- Infrastructure and cloud strategy
- Security and compliance frameworks
- DevOps and deployment strategies
- Vendor selection and technology partnerships
- Product development lifecycle management

**Principle Statement**
All architectural decisions must be evaluated and prioritized based on their direct contribution to customer value, ensuring that every system component, process, and capability serves authentic customer needs and measurable business outcomes.

**Rationale**
Customer focus is fundamental because it:
- Drives sustainable competitive advantage through superior customer experience
- Ensures optimal return on technology investments by focusing on high-impact capabilities

- Investment priorities realign toward customer-impacting capabilities
- Training requirements to develop customer empathy across technical teams

*Technical Implications:*
- User experience considerations drive system architecture choices
- Performance requirements based on actual customer workflows and expectations
- API designs prioritize developer experience and ease of integration
- Monitoring and observability focus on customer-impacting metrics
- Testing strategies emphasize user journey validation over purely technical metrics

*Process Implications:*
- Architecture review processes require customer impact assessments
- Release planning incorporates customer feedback and usage analytics
- Design thinking methodologies become standard practice
- Regular customer research informs technical roadmap decisions

**Related Principles**
- **User-Centric Design**: Provides the design methodology framework for implementing customer focus
- **Business Agility**: Enables rapid response to evolving customer needs and market conditions
- **Innovation**: Drives creative problem-solving to address complex customer challenges
- **Interoperability**: Ensures customers can integrate with existing systems and workflows
- **Efficiency**: Optimizes resource utilization to deliver maximum customer value

**Examples**

*API Development:*
When designing the Custom Build Platform's REST APIs, conduct developer experience research to understand integration pain points, then design APIs with consistent naming conventions, comprehensive documentation, and meaningful error messages based on real developer feedback rather than technical convenience.

*Performance Architecture:*
Instead of optimizing all system components equally, analyze customer usage patterns to identify the most critical user journeys (e.g., application deployment, monitoring dashboards), then architect performance optimizations specifically for these high-impact scenarios.

*Feature Prioritization:*
Before implementing a new application template (e.g., Python microservices), conduct user research with target developers to understand their actual workflow challenges, development environment preferences, and deployment patterns, then design the template to address these validated needs.

*Infrastructure Design:*
Design auto-scaling policies based on actual customer traffic patterns and cost sensitivity rather than theoretical maximum loads, ensuring cost-effective scaling that aligns with real usage behavior while maintaining performance expectations.

*Security Implementation:*
Implement security controls that protect customer data while maintaining usability, such as adaptive authentication that balances security rigor with user experience, rather than implementing the most restrictive possible controls.

**Compliance**

*Measurement Metrics:*
- Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) for platform users
- Feature adoption rates and user engagement analytics
- Customer support ticket volume and resolution time trends
- Time-to-value metrics for new customer onboarding
- API usage patterns and developer satisfaction surveys
- User journey completion rates and abandonment points

*Governance Processes:*
- Mandatory customer impact assessment for all architectural decision records (ADRs)
- Quarterly customer advisory board participation in architectural planning sessions
- Customer journey mapping exercises required for major platform capabilities
- User acceptance testing criteria for all customer-facing releases
- Regular architecture reviews with customer success team representation

*Validation Methods:*
- A/B testing protocols for significant user-facing architectural changes
- Customer feedback integration into development sprint planning
- Usability testing requirements for new interfaces and workflows
- Customer success metrics included in team performance evaluations
- Post-implementation reviews measuring actual vs. projected customer value

## Technical Guiding Principles

- **Modularity**: Design components to be independent and reusable. The platform will be composed of independent, reusable components that can be developed, tested, and deployed separately. This approach enables easier maintenance, faster development cycles, and the flexibility to upgrade or replace individual modules without impacting the entire system.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the platform can handle increasing workloads efficiently. The system is designed to efficiently handle increasing workloads by supporting horizontal and vertical scaling. Services can be distributed across multiple nodes, and resources can be dynamically allocated to meet demand, ensuring consistent performance as usage grows.
- **Security**: Implement strong security measures to protect data and systems. Security is integrated at every layer of the platform, including strong authentication and authorization mechanisms, data encryption in transit and at rest, and regular security audits. The platform adheres to industry best practices and compliance standards to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Resiliency**: Ensure the platform can recover quickly from failures and maintain continuous operation. Resiliency is achieved through strategies such as redundancy, failover mechanisms, and automated recovery processes. The platform is designed to handle unexpected disruptions gracefully, minimizing downtime and impact on users. This includes:
  - Implementing multi-region deployments to ensure availability during regional outages.
  - Utilizing distributed systems and replication to safeguard data integrity.
  - Monitoring system health and performance to detect and address issues proactively.
  - Designing services with fault tolerance and self-healing capabilities.
  - Conducting regular disaster recovery drills to validate recovery procedures.
  - Leveraging load balancing to distribute traffic and prevent bottlenecks.
  - Ensuring critical components have backup systems and failover configurations.
- **Maintainability**: Facilitate easy updates and enhancements to the platform. The codebase and infrastructure are structured to facilitate easy updates, debugging, and enhancements. Clear documentation, automated testing, and standardized development practices help ensure that the platform remains reliable and adaptable to changing requirements.
- **Interoperability**: Support integration with diverse tools and technologies. The platform is designed to seamlessly connect with a wide range of third-party systems, services, and protocols, enabling users and partners to leverage existing investments and accelerate solution delivery. For example, a partner can integrate their CRM system with the platform using REST APIs to automate customer onboarding, or a customer can connect their on-premises data warehouse via standardized connectors to enable real-time analytics. This includes:
  - Providing well-documented APIs such as REST and GraphQL, and webhooks for external integrations.
  - Supporting industry-standard authentication and authorization mechanisms (OAuth2, SAML, OpenID Connect).
  - Ensuring compatibility with popular CI/CD, monitoring, and DevOps tools.
  - Enabling data exchange through standardized formats (JSON, XML, CSV) and protocols.
  - Facilitating integration with both cloud-native and on-premises systems.
  - Maintaining clear versioning and backward compatibility for APIs to minimize integration disruptions.
  - Offering SDKs and client libraries in multiple programming languages (such as Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, and Go) to accelerate partner and customer adoption.
