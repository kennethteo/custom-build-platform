# Security Automation Pipeline

## Goal

Standardize a golden pipeline that embeds security scanning, policy enforcement, and evidence capture with minimal friction.

## Stages (Concept)

| Stage | Purpose | Security Controls | Evidence |
|-------|---------|------------------|----------|
| Pre-Commit | Prevent obvious issues | Secrets scan, lint, basic SAST (fast) | Local logs |
| CI - Static | Deep code + dependency analysis | Full SAST, SCA, license, secret re-scan | JSON reports stored |
| CI - Build | Build artifact, SBOM, image scan | SBOM (syft), container scan (Trivy) | SBOM, scan report |
| CI - Test | Dynamic validation | DAST (targeted), API fuzz (if flagged) | DAST report |
| CI - Policy Gate | Enforce infra/runtime policies | IaC scan (tfsec), OPA bundles | Policy decision log |
| Signing & Publish | Integrity & provenance | cosign sign, attest build metadata | Sig + attestation |
| Deploy Admission | Runtime guardrails | Admission policy (OPA/Kyverno) | Admission logs |
| Runtime Monitoring | Detect anomalies | SIEM, eBPF sensor | Alert events |

## Pipeline Requirements

- Declarative config (e.g., pipeline.yaml) referencing reusable composite actions.
- Fail-fast design; non-blocking for non-critical findings.
- Parallelized scans where possible.
- Caching to minimize scan duration (dependency caches, SAST incremental analysis).

## Performance Budgets

- Total security overhead budget: â‰¤25% of total pipeline time (optimize iteratively).
- SAST target: < 5 min typical service.
- SCA: < 2 min incremental.

## Evidence Strategy

- All artifacts tagged with build ID, commit SHA, service name, version.
- Storage location: evidence bucket (encryption at rest, lifecycle policies).

## Extensibility

- Pluggable hooks for future: container runtime scanning, supply chain attest enhancements, ML-based anomaly detection.

## Roadmap Alignment

- Supports Q1 SBOM/signing, Q2 policy expansion, Q3 threat modeling assist, Q4 runtime anomaly automation.

## Open Items

- Confirm orchestrator to finalize admission controller approach.
- Tool selections where TBD.
