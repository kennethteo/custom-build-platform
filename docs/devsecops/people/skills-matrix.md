## Levels

| Level | Descriptor | General Security Behaviours |
|-------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| 1 | Aware | Follows secure coding checklist |
| 2 | Practitioner | Proactively identifies basic risks, fixes vulns without guidance |
| 3 | Advanced | Performs threat modeling, optimizes scans, mentors peers |
| 4 | Expert | Designs systemic controls, leads incident response |

## Competencies by Track

| Competency | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 |
